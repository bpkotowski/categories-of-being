# Notes

## Predicate:
 * The predicate is a semantic unit that takes one or more arguments and relates these arguments to each other.
 * A predicate is seen as a property that a subject has or is characterized by. A predicate is therefore an expression that can be true of something.[4] Thus, the expression "is moving" is true of anything that is moving.
 * The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like. 
 * The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like.
 *  This traditional understanding of predicates has a concrete reflex in all phrase structure theories of syntax.
 * understanding sees predicates as relations or functions over arguments. The predicate serves either to assign a property to a single argument or to relate two or more arguments to each other. 
 * Bob laughed. → laughed (Bob), or laughed = ƒ(Bob)
Sam helped you. → helped (Sam, you)
Jim gave Jill his dog. → gave (Jim, Jill, his dog)
Predicates are placed on the left outside of brackets, whereas the predicate's arguments are placed inside the brackets.

## Proposition:
 * a tentative and conjectural relationship between constructs that is stated in a declarative form. An example of a proposition is: “An increase in student intelligence causes an increase in their academic achievement.” This declarative statement does not have to be true, but must be empirically testable using data, so that we can judge whether it is true or false. Propositions are generally derived based on logic (deduction) or empirical observations (induction). Because propositions are associations between abstract constructs, they cannot be tested directly. Instead, they are tested indirectly by examining the relationship between corresponding measures (variables) of those constructs. The empirical formulation of propositions, stated as relationships between variables, is called hypotheses 
 * Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. 
 * Some philosophers argue that some (or all) kinds of speech or actions besides the declarative ones also have propositional content. For example, yes–no questions present propositions, being inquiries into the truth value of them. On the other hand, some signs can be declarative assertions of propositions without forming a sentence nor even being linguistic, e.g. traffic signs convey definite meaning which is either true or false.
