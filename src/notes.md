## **About Me**

I was a Creative Director for a gift and home accents manufacturer. Product Design/Management, Art Licensing, and Marketing were my main responsibilities. Marketing included our wholesale and retail websites where I gained basic experience in HTML and CSS. I designed and styled our webpages in Adobe and other software. But all the interactive coding was contracted out to javaScript developers. I supported back end functions by maintaining and updating the databases for our online catalogs. I also sourced factories overseas to determine production capabilities for import to distribute products to department stores, chain retailers, etc.

While in India, I discovered one of our manufacturing partners was outsourcing production to a factory that utilized child labor. It's very common in developing countries and I realized that no matter what I did in the industry, my work was contributing  to the suffering of others. I left my career, moved to a small mountain town in North Carolina to re-think my life and become a better person.

I accepted an invitation to drive across the country on a three month adventure to help a friend move to Portland. I experienced a freedom, an amazing sense of independence on an epic journey where I took risks and challenged my fears. It was profound and I realized my life had become stale, limited, a and broader vision was needed for me to grow and continue that feeling I had on that adventure.

After leaving my career, I no longer utilized my skills and finding a job working in graphic design needed to be updated as so much has changed since I was working as a professional. The program I'm in is helping me to learn about aspects of development I was curious to know more about but I never made time to consider. I'm studying to become more independent and to create and help others to create.
